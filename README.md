# Gear Fraud
Have you ever wanted to pull up to a raid party and show off to your teammates with all your perfect shiny gear but you spent all your LE horse gambling in ternaves?
This mod offers the perfect solution for this common scenario!

With Gear Fraud installed, you can make it appear to anyone gear checking you as if you've got the most expensive items on the server while still continueing to terrorise the party finder with your morph build!

Wynntils developers hate this simple trick!

## Features
For every item slot that can be shared via gear view, you can decide if it should be shown as perfect, defective or shiny.
If you make the item shiny, you can also choose which stat it tracks, what the current number is and how many tracker rerolls it has.
You can also completely replace your worn item with a wynntils item code (like the one used in chat messages). If you do that, all other settings for that slots will be overriden.

## Troubleshooting
The wynntils gear view feature can be a finicky so here are a few things to try if it's not working for you:
1. Make sure you have gear sharing enabled (check with /wynntils gearsharing)
2. Make sure you are connected to hades (you can reconnect with /wynntils reauth)
3. Sometimes hades just hasn't updated its cache of your items yet. Use /class to force an update
